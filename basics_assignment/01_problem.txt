1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
* 
'hello'
-87.8
- 
/ 

6 

1_ans.
* -->operator
'hello' --> value (string)
-87.8  -->value(float)
-  --> operator
/ --> operator


2. What is the difference between string and variable?
2ans> String is a collection of characters whereas varible is the named memory location for storing data.

3. Describe three different data types.
3ans>
string data-type - collection of characters
integer- denotes integral values positive or negetive.
float - denoted floating point values

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
4ans> An expression is made up of values, variables, and operators that are combined to produce another value. 
For example, 2 + 3 is an expression that evaluates to 5. All expressions perform some computation and return a result.


5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
5ans>
An expression evaluates to a value. For example, 2 + 3 is an expression that evaluates to 5.
A statement performs an action. For example, an assignment statement like spam = 10 assigns the value 10 to the variable spam. Statements do not return values.




6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
6ans>
The variable bacon will still contain 22 because the expression bacon + 1 is not assigned back to bacon.


7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
7ans>
spanspamspam
spamspamspam


8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
8ans.>eggs is a valid variable name because it follows the naming rules (starts with a letter and contains only letters, numbers, and underscores).
100 is invalid as a variable name because variable names cannot start with a digit.


9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
int() - Converts a value to an integer.
float() - Converts a value to a floating-point number.
str() - Converts a value to a string.


10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
10ans. The problem here is we are trying to concatenate 2 different data types i.e. string and int which is not possible we can convert the int to string to prevent error.

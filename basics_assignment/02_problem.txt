1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
1ans.
Boolean values are True(1) nad False(0). 

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
ans. 
and 
or
not

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
3ans
print(0 and 0) 0
print(0 and 1) 0
print(1 and 0) 0
print(1 and 1) 1
print(0 or 0)  0
print(0 or 1)  1
print(1 or 0)  1
print(1 or 1)  1
print( not 0)  1
print( not 1)  0

4. What are the values of the following expressions?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) 
ans. false

not (5 > 4)
ans. False

(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
ans. true

not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
ans.False

(True and True) and (True == False)
ans.False

(not False) or (not True)
ans. True


5. What are the six comparison operators?
ans.
>  <  >=  <=  ==  !=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
ans.
= operator is used for assignment, usually used to assign a value to a memory location
== is equal to and is used to check whether they are equal or not

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0

if spam == 10:

print('eggs')

if spam > 5:

print('bacon')

else:

print('ham')

print('spam')

print('spam')

ans.
spam = 0

if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')

if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')

else:
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
    print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
ans.
spam=int(input("Enterthe number-"))
if spam==1:
    print(1)
elif spam==2:
    print(2)
else:
    print("Greetings!")


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
ans.
ctrl + call

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
ans. 
break is reserved key word which is used to break out of loop or say stop the further continuation of the loop whereas continue skips a iteration we can say that everything below it is skipped 

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
ans.
range(10) it begins from 0 to 10 here 0 is by default ,default step=1
range(0,10) it also begins with 0 to 10 here we can change the initial value,default step=1
range(0,10,1) it beigins with 0 continues till 10 with step 1 step can be changed

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
12ans.

# using for loop
for i in range (0,11):
    print(i)

# using while loop
i=0
while i<11:
    print(i)
    i+=1
